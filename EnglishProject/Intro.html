		<p class="bio">		Being a man comes with a whole list of unspoken but enforced rules to follow with societal consequences if you step out of line. That is what toxic masculinity is, at least in plain terms.
	According to more academic speaking, “Toxic masculinity is a narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status and aggression. It’s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured” (Clemens).
The actions of men who follow the standards of toxic masculinity are very harmful to women and other people affected by misogyny, including men.
Under toxic masculinity, it is normal and even encouraged for men to catcall, harass, and sexualize women with or without their permission. Toxic masculinity allows men to feel entitled to take advantage of girls and women.
This isn’t to say that all men are bad or completely at fault for the structures that have been in place for centuries.
I think sometimes people underestimate how many little things go into toxic masculinity and how those things can have large scale effects.
Toxic masculinity also contributes to rape culture because of the standards of how men are expected to treat women.
I think sometimes people underestimate how many little things go into rape culture and how many people truly are a part of the 97%.
