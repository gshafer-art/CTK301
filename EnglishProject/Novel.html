<h2> Anthony Frame, “I Said Yes” </h2>
		<p class="bio">

			“I Said Yes” is about Anthony Frame’s experiences as a boy and young man where he faces many problems because of the anger and violence of men in his life.
			As a teenager, Anthony tries his best to fit in with the other boys at his school. He does find a group of friends and remarks about them, “The only one of us who could have been called cool was Josh. Tall, leather jacket, hair dripping with grease, he was our grunge God. From him I learned to swear like a man, to drop the words fuck, bitch, and pussy in my sentences as smoothly and as frequently as the word the.” (Frame 216). Josh was considered the coolest guy because of how he dressed and acted. The narrator said that “I learned to swear like a man” which again falls in line with the standards of toxic masculinity because the words that they used were harmful to women. Using words like “bitch” and pussy” are derogatory terms towards women and part of toxic masculinity is treating women like objects.
			While hanging out in the cafeteria, Josh says, “‘God, how old are the Olsen twins now? [...] I’m too ready to jerk off to them”’ (Frame 217). Talking about sex and women is another trait of toxic masculinity. This can be very harmful for men who never learn how to have meaningful relationships with women. “When we’re taught that an entire gender exists purely to satisfy others’ needs, it dehumanizes millions of people, and it’s very difficult to have empathy for someone that you don’t view as a real person.” (Tran). The Olsen twins being celebrities already adds an aspect of dehumanization and the way Josh talks about them as young women simply magnifies that.
			When Josh gets a girlfriend, he brings her over to hang out with all his friends, including the narrator. Anthony is uncomfortable with the way Josh treats Kate in front of all his friends and he thinks, “I wanted to tell her that Josh was using her, tell her all about the things he said when she wasn’t around, how she was fun even if she is sloppy seconds, how he loves to screw her in the ass” (Frame 223). Anthony recognizes that how Josh talks about his girlfriend is harmful, but he doesn’t know how to fix the problem. This shows how toxic masculinity is such a widespread issue that is encouraged by the media and society that even a good man has difficulty trying to stop it.

<h2>Lyz Lenz, “All the Angry Women”</h2>
<p class="bio">

	This story is about Lyz Lenz, a woman who holds group therapy sessions for women to release their anger and frustration in a healthy way. She pulls on her own experiences being told to stop being angry to help support the women in her group.
	At the beginning of this passage, Lyz talks about how her sisters got into a car accident. She says that, “I had to fight my family to keep the man who had sexually abused her for three years in her teens out of her room in the ICU” (Lenz 155-156). Her sister was married to the man that abused her other sister and her family made excuses for him. Excusing negative behavior of men, particularly abusers, upholds rape culture. Her family should not have made any excuses for the man who abused Lyz’s sister and yet they did because of the standards of society. Men are allowed to treat women badly because “they can’t help it” and “boys will be boys”.

	Lyz talks a lot about her anger in this passage and how she doesn’t have a place for it. In contrast, she says, “Abusers have a pathology. They have a system. They have restraining orders and court-mandated anger management classes. Once, I heard a news story about sex offenders who had been driven out of their homes by laws mandating that they stay away from schools. A hotel opened its doors to them so they wouldn't be homeless. Even they had a place to lay their heads” (Lenz 158-159). The fact that sex offenders are shown kindness when their victims are often shamed is a part of rape culture. Society places much more blame on victims than abusers, which perpetuates the cycle of abuse. We also see this in Not That Bad where Chanel is publicly shamed on the internet for filing a case against Brock.

	Lyz talks about one of the group therapy members and how she has had a difficult experience, “Sandy, a woman in one of my Tuesday night groups, speaks softly, but carries years of abuse and pain inside her. She told me a story of a group of men at her church critiquing her appearance. “That,” she said, in a voice that I had to lean forward to here, “makes me angry and, well, that's just not nice, is it?”’ (Lenz 159). Sandy’s experience with men is familiar for most women. Under toxic masculinity, women are told to smile and not be angry for the benefit of men. They are expected to be emotional caretakers without ever feeling and showing their negative emotions. This is very difficult for women to experience, and in the focus group Lyz leads, many women have similar stories. This also contributes to rape culture since when women act demure and nice they are attacked for not fighting back against abusers. Even though society tells women that they should smile and be polite to everyone, even if they are uncomfortable.
