		<p class="bio">		The novel Grown is about Enchanted, a high school girl whose passion is to become a professional singer. She meets Korey Fields, a 28 year old famous musician who offers to become Enchanted’s mentor. However, he soon leads Enchanted into an abusive relationship where he controls her every action.
When Korey introduces Enchanted to the recording studio, he sets up some rules of how they are going to use the space. “‘One, no one can know what goes down in here [...] you can't be giving away our secrets, you feel me? So you can't tell no one, not even your moms’” (Jackson 79). The very first rule Korey says to Enchanted is that she can’t tell anyone what happens in the studio, including her parents. Phrases such as “no one can know what goes down in here” and “you can’t be giving away our secrets” highlights how Korey is trying to hide his behavior with Enchanted. As an audience we can recognize Korey’s behavior as signs of grooming but in the situation Enchanted doesn’t. Korey fits into the stereotypes of toxic masculinity by the way he treats Enchanted.
Korey continues to talk about the rules he made about the studio, saying “‘[...] we don't just make music in here. We make love, you feel me? [...] And you gotta start by shedding some of them layers [...] I don't even walk in here with shoes on”’ (Jackson 79). By saying “I don’t even walk in here with shoes on” Korey compares being barefoot to taking off clothing, which are very different things in this situation. His word choice saying “shedding some of them layers” is an informal choice to put Enchanted at ease. Telling someone to shed some layers sounds like taking off your coat when it’s too hot outside rather than the situation of taking off a sweatshirt to reveal a more tight fitting shirt. Korey knows that if he pushes Enchanted boundaries too fast, she will know what he is doing is wrong and will resist. So instead, he continues to push Enchanted’s boundaries slowly by talking to her as if they were of a similar age. He talks about adult acts like having sex but, he does so in a way to make it seem like normal behavior. Saying “we make love” is a much less harsh word choice than talking about having sex and he compares it to making music which is something Enchanted is already okay with. This further gives him power in their relationship. In order to fit in with toxic masculinity standards, men must hold power over others, particularly women. Korey is a victim of these pressures and reacts to them by trying to control Enchanted. Toxic masculinity allows men to feel entitled to take advantage of girls and women.
Korey is characterized as a manipulative person by the way he talks to and treats Enchanted. While Korey is explaining his rules of the studio, Enchanted takes off her sweatshirt at his request. Korey reacts by saying, ‘“Wow. You are...so beautiful [...] I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's just that...I mean, you are mad gorgeous! Them eyes...Every time you look at me, I forget myself”’ (Jackson 79). Korey gives Enchanted a compliment and then follows it up with saying that he “shouldn’t have said that”. This phrasing by Korey highlights his characterization as a manipulative person. He acknowledges that he shouldn’t say inappropriate things to Enchanted in a way that desensitizes her to his inappropriate behaviors. He says “Every time you look at me, I forget myself” which is putting the fault of Korey’s behavior on Enchanted by claiming it’s just because she’s “mad gorgeous” so he can’t help himself from making comments about her appearance. This manipulation of women is another trait of toxic masculinity, particularly when it has to do with a woman’s appearance. Toxic masculinity encourages men to make comments on women’s bodies and allows them to justify their actions based on that. Furthermore, because men are considered to be more powerful than women under the ideas of toxic masculinity, they are allowed to control women.
The characterization of Korey, his informal diction, and dramatic irony all play a part in demonstrating how toxic masculinity can encourage harmful behaviors towards women. Even though Enchanted is underaged, Korey feels as though he has a right to her body because of the toxic masculinity ideas he has digested from society.
