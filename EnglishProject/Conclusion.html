		<p class="bio">	I think I’ve learned a lot about rape culture throughout this class. However, I do feel like it’s such a complex topic that it’s hard to quantify my learning. I think my background knowledge was random and spotty and this class “filled in some holes” so to speak. I think I really noticed some learning on the jamboard where we discussed toxic masculinity and toxic femininity. I feel like sometimes these terms are just thrown around so it was very helpful to see them written out with examples. Going along with that, I feel like it was easier to see how rape culture and gender affected everyone when we read Grown. I think the discussions we had in class were much more focused, perhaps because it was a very serious topic. I’m still very proud of the paper I wrote on it as I really had a solid foundation with the short analysis I wrote and my thesis just made more sense to me.
I think the way my brain processed this class was in like separate sections though, kind of like how I wrote this paper. Like I understood how the way toxic masculinity was bad in different situations and how it’s a bigger problem than just a few sexist guys, but connecting concepts like that, and expectations around gender, and rape culture was hard to do. I think it’s such a nuanced concept that without a ton of prior knowledge it’s hard to comprehend fully.
