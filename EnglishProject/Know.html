			Know My Name is about Chanel Miller’s experience after her sexual assault by Brock Turner and the court case that happened after.

When Chanel was recovering from her assault, she traveled to a town and took printmaking classes. Whilst there, she often walked around the town and during one such walk, “[she] passed three men sitting on a car who fastened their eyes on my legs, clicked their tongues, and smacked their lips, performing these sounds and hand gestures one might use if attempting to summon a cat” (Miller 80). This is one of the many negative experiences she had with male strangers during her stay at this town. However, this is not a unique experience as most women can point to times in their life where they were made to feel uncomfortable or unsafe by men. The catcalling that Chanel describes is one behavior that stems from toxic masculinity. Men feeling that they are entitled to comment on women’s bodies contributes to rape culture as well.

Chanel remembers the manifesto of Elliot Rodger, a man who shot many people near her campus a few years ago. She writes, “His cruelty had a narrative arc. He spoke like he had never wanted to do what he did, he was pushed too. And it was women who had made him suffer, who left him no choice but to execute his Day of Retribution. In his video, he'd said I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me. His hostility was born of entitlement, self-pity. I will punish all females for the crime of depriving me of sex” (Miller 90). Elliot’s behavior is very telling of the dangers of toxic masculinity. As Chanel said, he felt entitled to women’s bodies and when they did not want to sleep with him, he decided to kill them instead. This gender based violence is one of the most dangerous effects of toxic masculinity.

During Chanel’s trial she was treated very differently than Turner. She shows this by saying, “Brock was allowed a messy mind. Victims often have inconsistencies due to trauma blockage, alcoholic gaps. His inconsistencies came from what he said before he had a lawyer vs. what he said after he hired one. When Brock was arrested and questioned by the detective, all these supposed dialogue between us that he failed to mention was not due to a lack of memory. It was due to the fact that he did not have an attorney to help him construct a narrative, feed him words, brush the clouds from his mind, and figure out which story might get him off scot-free” (Miller 199). The way that Brock and his lawyer behaved during the trial was a result of the effects of toxic mascunlity and rape culture. They blamed Chanel for drinking and for leaving her friends for a moment as the cause of her being sexually assaulted. Turner’s lawyer claimed that Brock had asked for and received consent from Chanel, despite the fact that she was unconscious during the event. Victim blaming is a big part of rape culture and this happened throughout the court case.
