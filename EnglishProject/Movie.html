		<p class="bio">		Legally Blonde is a movie about the main character, Elle Woods as she decides to go to law school after her boyfriend dumps her on the night she thought he was going to propose.
When Elle Woods goes to her first party at Harvard she is told it’s a costume party so she goes dressed as a playboy bunny. When she arrives, no one else is in costume and many of the people there make comments about her appearance or check her out. Warner, Elle’s ex-boyfriend even goes as far as to say, “Wow! Well don’t you look like a walking felony” (41:37). While this phrase may seem like a harmless joke, it’s not. Warner making a rape joke is a part of toxic masculinity. So-called “locker room talk” where men objectify women is harmful to the way they treat and think of them. And Warner going so far as to say these thoughts to Elle shows how he doesn’t realize what he is saying is bad. This also perpetuates rape culture by blaming the victim for getting raped based on what clothes they are wearing by calling Elle a “walking felony” for wearing a more revealing costume.
While Elle is still talking to Warner, he says he is busy with classwork and she responds, “I know what you mean, I can’t imagine doing all this and Callahan’s internship next year. That’s gonna be so much”. Warner responds by saying,“Oh, Elle, come on, you're never gonna get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You’re not smart enough sweetie” (42:10). Throughout the movie, Warner constantly belittles Elle despite her being very intelligent. She had a very high GPA and LSAT score and was accepted into Harvard Law school but Warner refuses to acknowledge her intelligence. This contributes to toxic masculinity because his behavior is solely based on the fact that she is a stereotypically feminine woman. Under toxic masculinity standards, men are superior to women in every way. He straight up insults her intelligence by saying “you’re not smart enough sweetie”. He also uses pet names like “sweetie” and “pooh bear” toward Elle even though they are not dating, which is very condescending.
Callahan, Elle’s law professor, hits on Elle by complimenting her skills. He invades her personal space and puts his hand on her leg and asks, “How far will Elle go?”. Once she denies his advances, he says, “You’re a beautiful girl. I’m a man who knows what he wants. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer” (1:14:54). This statement threatens Elle’s position as an intern at his law firm and her grade in his class. Callahan takes advantage of his position of power to try and gain something from Elle. This perpetuates toxic masculinity where men feel entitled to women's bodies. He also insinuates that the only way she’ll ever become a lawyer if she sleeps around by saying “I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer”. This supports another idea of toxic masculinity that women are inferior to men because Callahn doesn’t think Elle can become a lawyer on her skills alone. Callahan treats his female interns much differently than his male interns and Elle is no exception to this. This situation also relates to Grown, where Korey takes advantage of his authority to control Enchanted.
